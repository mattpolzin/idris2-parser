||| Witness that a pair of a snoclist and a list
||| is the result of shifting values from the head of
||| an initial list to the tail of an initial snoclist.
|||
||| This data type is a witness for what a lexer does:
||| taking a finite number of elements from the head of a
||| list and appending them to the tail of a snoclist.
|||
||| By carrying around such a proof, we guarantee that no
||| character is lost during lexing, and that the order of
||| characters does not change during lexing.
|||
||| @ strict : `True` if at least one element was shifted
||| @ sx     : the current snoclist
||| @ xs     : the current list
||| @ giro   : the initial snoclist
||| @ orig   : the initial list
